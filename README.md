# Private Routes Project

This project is for practice purposes. It demonstrates how to create private routes in a React application. Private routes are sections of the app that only logged-in users can access, providing a secure way to restrict certain pages or features. This setup includes user authentication and redirection to ensure that only authorized users can view protected content.
